# Torified
Allows you to connect to Minecraft servers via Tor
## Prerequisites
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/)
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)
## How To Use
Go to the path where you installed Tor Browser and from there go to Browser/TorBrowser/Tor, then run the program in that directory. This will be referred to as the Tor standalone.

Once it finishes starting, you will be able to use Tor. Enable or disable its usage in the top right corner.

To get a new Tor circuit (new IP) simply restart the Tor standalone.

If you try to connect when Tor is not running but you have Tor enabled, it will fail to connect.
